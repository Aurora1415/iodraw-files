I know that in some ways a computer is easy to use, but I’ll explain why mine is quite difficult at first, at least for most people. You see, I bought a special set-up from the computer market because I am a huge fan of gaming – and the games I play require a lot of fast memory and a lot of power – so the computer has some top of the range graphics cards in it, and needs to be set up in a certain way. In fact, depending on what game I need to play, I need to make some hardware changes – change certain boards inside for others, and rig up a cooling system. See… it’s sounding complicated already! So, you see, at first I found this quite hard to get to grips with and I had to watch a few online videos and ask for some advice along the way. Then I had to do some very basic programming stuff to set it up – so the whole thing worked properly. I’m not sure how to explain that process, but anyway. I use the computer almost daily. When I’ve finished my studies and other things I need to do, I get going and start playing. I sometimes play games with people from all over the world and I play these open-world huge fantasy games. My characters are a wizard and a warrior. I love this one particular game so much – it’s also quite complex to get used to, but when you know how to play, it’s fantastic – I can spend literally hours on end playing it. Sometimes my parents get annoyed because I spend so long on my computer, but to be honest, I’m quite disciplined with my studies, and don’t have much of an outside social life, so I manage my time pretty well. So, generally my hobby doesn’t interfere with other important aspects of my life.&lt;/span&gt;" style="text;html=1;align=center;verticalAlign=middle;resizable=0;points=[];autosize=1;" vertex="1" parent="1"><mxGeometry x="-6180" y="380" width="12240" height="20" as="geometry"/></mxCell></root></mxGraphModel>
