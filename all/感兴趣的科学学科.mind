When I took an introductory course in science.\n\n\nWe studied topics like climate change,\n\n\nbiodiversity and the impact of human activities on the environment.\n\n\nIt was eye opening to learn about the delicate balance in nature,\n\n\nandhow everything is interconnected.\n\n\nSince then,\n\n\ni've continued to explore environmental science through various means.\n\n\nI read books and research articles.\n\n\nandI follow several environmental science pod casts\n\n\nand documentaries to stay updated on the latest developments.\n\n\nAdditionally,\n\n\ni've taken a few online courses to deepen my knowledge,\n\n\nespecially about sustainability and renewable energy.\n\n\nWhat really draws me to environmental science is its relevance to today's world\n\n\nwith the growing concerns about climate change,\n\n\npollution and resource depletion,\n\n\nunderstanding these issues has become more important than ever.\n\n\nI feel that this subject gives me the tools to not only understand the problems,\n\n\nbut also think about potential solutions.\n\n\nI'm especially interested in how science can help create more sustainable practices,\n\n\nwhether it's in agriculture,\n\n\nenergy production or urban planning.\n\n\nThe idea of contributing to a healthier planet is both inspiring and motivating to me,\n\n\nwhich is why I continue to learn and stay engaged with this field."},"children":[]}]}]},"template":"default","theme":"fresh-blue","version":"1.4.43"}
